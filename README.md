# plasmode
R package for plasmode simulations in the IRT context

This repository provides a R package to conduct plasmode simulations in the context of person, item and model fit statistics based on the Item-Response-Theory. It contains a function to create plasmode datasets on person and item level and functions to evaluate how different fit statistics react to plasmode datasets, which I investigated in my bachelor's thesis. The package was created and published in the framework of this thesis, as well. 

The package can be installed in different ways: For example, the file can be downloaded and installed locally: Note that in this case, the mirt package needs to be installed beforehand. This proceeds automatically, when installing the package by means of the remotes package.
